This is a final project left opened ended to allow stuednts to be creative. Overall, students still need to be able to conduct research on a policy and a social movement about the policy. 
Once the final project is complete, students will complete a final reflection about what they have learned while makeing their final project. The final reflection will include a bibliography and how they were useful.

## Policy

privacy under the right to be forgotten 

## Social Movement

GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation
GDPR is a EU law that address data protection and privacy
nobody fought for it, but they decided to make it to update a previous outdataed bill

## what i learned

so far, nothing as im just planning everything

## ideas

- history of the bill
- how it is being applied today
- how the people could use it
- are there loopholes?
- the comparison to data protections around the world
- tons of stats and data to prove that there needs to be data protections aorund the world

## what i would do differently

if i was given extra time, i would have organized the given inforamtion better and i would have coded the entire site in typescript
