This is a final project left opened ended to allow stuednts to be creative. Overall, students still need to be able to conduct research on a policy and a social movement about the policy. 
Once the final project is complete, students will complete a final reflection about what they have learned while makeing their final project. The final reflection will include a bibliography and how they were useful.

## Policy

privacy under the right to be forgotten 

## Social Movement

GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation
GDPR is a EU law that address data protection and privacy
nobody fought for it, but they decided to make it to update a previous outdataed bill

## what i learned

so far, nothing as im just planning everything

## ideas

- history of the bill
- how it is being applied today
- how the people could use it
- are there loopholes?
- the comparison to data protections around the world
- tons of stats and data to prove that there needs to be data protections aorund the world

## what i would do differently

if i was given extra time, i would have organized the given inforamtion better and i would have coded the entire site in typescript
i wouldn't have change my idea for the entire website a 3 days before it was due casuing me to double my work load jsut beacuse i didn't like it, like something just felt off about it
i would like to have the time to be able to include javascript to enable a unique feeling to my website, from stalling sections that force you to scroll more than you think to image that seem to be stuck in the background using true js. Maybe i would gamble my time and try 3 animations or custom images to make my website mine. until i try again, these will only be lofty goals.
